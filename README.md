# UAVsDesignApp
Application developed using Python and QT. The app uses a UI to give basic aerodynamic calculations and dimensioning of an aircraft (specifically UAVs)  after the user has entered some basic parameters. The application also has the option to save and open the files with the information.

NOTE:
The creator has no intention to keep improving and updating the app. Instead, it is working on the same application but now, using C++ and QT. It is expected to have a final version of the new app by early 2024 that will include some other functionalities like the ability to graph and analyze wing profiles
